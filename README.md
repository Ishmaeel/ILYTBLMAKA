I love you, Todoist, but leave my arrow keys alone!

## FAQ

* **What?**

  [Todoist](https://todoist.com/) generally presents a wonderful user experience, but it binds <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>Arrow</kbd> keys to indent/unindent the selected task. This makes text editing a bit harder than it needs to be, especially if you're used to having these key combinations to skip over words or select whole words.
  
  This userscript disables Todoist's <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>LeftArrow</kbd> and <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>RightArrow</kbd> keyboard bindings to re-enable the default textbox behavior when editing tasks.
  
* **How?**

  Just install with your userscript manager (GreaseMonkey, TamperMonkey) and jump over those word boundaries like a boss.

* **Is it compatible with the awesome [todoist-shortcuts](https://github.com/mgsloan/todoist-shortcuts) extension** (that you don't seem to have any affiliation with) **?**

  Yep.
  
* **Does it steal my private data and valuable property?**

  Only your heart.
